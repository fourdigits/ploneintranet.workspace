Development notes
=================

* The Participation policies are built on dynamic PAS group/role plugins from `collective.workspace <https://github.com/collective/collective.workspace>`_
* New ‘self-publisher’ role allows users to publish their own content, but not the content of others (something that cannot be achieved with existing contributor/editor/reviewer roles). This is achieved using a borg.localrole adapter
