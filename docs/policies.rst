The Policies
============

Three realms of access are controlled via a single ‘policies’ tab on the workspace container:

External visibility
-------------------

Who can see the workspace and its content?

* Secret
    
  - Workspace and content are only visible to members

* Private

  - Workspace is visible to non-members
  - 'Published' Workspace content only visible to members
  - 'Public' Workspace content visible to all

* Open

  - Workspace is visible to non-members
  - 'Published' Workspace content visible to all

Join policy
-----------
Who can join / add users to a workspace?

* Admin-managed

  - Only workspace administrators can add users

* Team-managed

  - All existing workspace members can add users

* Self-Managed

  - Any user can self-join the workspace

Participation policy
--------------------

What can members of the workspace do?

* Consumers

  - Members can read all published content

* Producers

  - Members can create new content, and submit for review

* Publishers

  - Members can create, edit and publish their own content
    (but not the content of others)

* Moderators

  - Members can create, edit and publish their own content
    *and* content created by others.

Policy Scenarios
================

These policies are designed to be combined in ways that produce sensible policy scenarios. Some example use cases might be:

* Open + Self-managed + Publishers = Community/Wiki
* Open + Admin-managed + Consumers = Business Division/Department
* Private + Team-managed + Publishers = Team
